Chapter 2 - Documenting JavaScript
==================================

* Install NodeJS from http://nodejs.org - which installs the command line tool 'npm' (Node Package Manager) - see Chapter 14 for more

* Install YUIDoc from the command prompt with the command:

npm -g install yuidocjs

* Navigate to this folder from the command prompt

* Execute the following command to generate full documentation from the code in this folder:

 yuidoc -n .

This will create a new folder called 'out' within this directory containing the generated documentation site.
